**Region quadtrees and efficient neighbour finding techniques in Go**

**Go-rquad** proposes various implementations of **region quadtrees**.

A region quadtree is a special kind of quadtree that recursively
subdivides a 2 dimensional space into 4 smaller and generally equal
rectangular regions, until the wanted quadtree resolution has been reached,
or no further subdivisions can be performed.

Region quadtrees can be used for image processing; in this case a leaf node
represents a rectangular region of an image in which all colors are equal or
the color difference is under a given threshold.

Region quadtrees may also be used to represent data fields with variable 
resolution. For example, the temperatures in an area may be stored as a
quadtree where each leaf node stores the average temperature over the
subregion it represents.

In this package, quadtrees implement the [`imgscan.Scanner`](https://github.com/arl/imgtools/tree/master/imgscan) interface,
this provides a way to scan (i.e extract) the pixels in order to perform the subdivisions.

## API Overview

### `Node` interface
```go
type Node interface {
        Parent() Node
        Child(Quadrant) Node
        Bounds() image.Rectangle
        Color() Color
        Location() Quadrant
}
```

### `Quadtree` interface

A `Quadtree` represents a hierarchical collection of `Node`s, its API is
simple: access to the root Node and a way to iterate over all the leaves.

```go
type Quadtree interface {
        ForEachLeaf(Color, func(Node))
        Root() Node
}
```

### Functions

`Locate` returns the leaf node of `q` that contains `pt`, or nil if `q` doesn't contain `pt`.
```go
func Locate(q Quadtree, pt image.Point) Node
```

`ForEachNeighbour` calls `fn` for each neighbour of `n`.
```go
func ForEachNeighbour(n Node, fn func(Node))
```

### Basic implementation: `BasicTree` and `basicNode`

`BasicTree` is in many ways the standard implementation of `Quadtree`, it just does the job.

### State of the art implementation: `CNTree` and `CNNode`

`CNTree` or **Cardinal Neighbour Quadtree** implements state of the art techniques:
 - from any given leaf node, its neighbours (of any size) are accessed in constant time *0(1)*  as they implement the  *Cardinal Neighbour Quadtree* technique (cf Safwan Qasem 2015). The time complexity reduction is obtained through the addition of only four pointers per leaf node in the quadtree.
 - fast point location queries (locating which leaf node contains a specific point), thanks to the *binary branching method* (cf Frisken Perry 2002). This simple and efficient method is nonrecursive, table free, and reduces the number of comparisons with
poor predictive behavior, that are otherwise required with the standard method.
