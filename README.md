**Quadtrees and efficient neighbour finding techniques in Go**

Package `rquad` proposes various implementations of **region quadtrees**.
The region quadtree is a special kind of quadtree that recursively
subdivides a 2D dimensional space into 4, smaller and generally equal
rectangular regions, until the wanted quadtree resolution has been reached,
or no further subdivisions can be performed.

Region quadtree may be used for image processing, in this case a node
represents a rectangular region of an image in which all pixels have the
same color.

A region quadtree may also be used as a variable resolution representation
of a data field. For example, the temperatures in an area may be stored as a
quadtree, with each leaf node storing the average temperature over the
subregion it represents.

Quadtree implementations in this package use the `binimg.Scanner` interface to
represent the complete area and provide the quadtree with a way to scan over
regions of this area in order to perform the subdivisions.
